# Netflix_Movie_Analysis
In this project, I conducted an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Netflix movie data to investigate the trend of movie durations over time. The analysis involved filtering the dataset to focus on movies, examining the duration of films, and identifying any patterns or factors contributing to the hypothesis that movies are getting shorter. The project also includes a visual representation of movie durations by release year, categorized by genre, to provide deeper insights. This EDA project showcases my ability to manipulate and analyze data, as well as visualize results using Python and Matplotlib.
